2. **Relationship Over Transaction**: Develop long-term collector relationships
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on serious collectors with investment capability
4. **Exclusive Access**: Use scarcity and privacy to create desire
5. **Trust Through Expertise**: Leverage The Arkenstone's reputation and knowledge
