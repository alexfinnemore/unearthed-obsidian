## Exhibition Concept Sketches - Underground Crystal Labyrinth

### Prompt 1: Architectural Cross-Section Overview
"Rough architectural cross-section sketch of an underground multi-level crystal exhibition labyrinth, drawn in black ink on white paper with loose, hand-drawn lines. Cutaway side view showing 2-3 underground levels connected by winding passages and irregular chambers. The layout should be maze-like and non-linear, with rooms of varying sizes - some confined cave-like tunnels, others opening into larger luxury chambers. Include narrow winding cave passages with rough stone walls, larger circular and rectangular chambers for crystal displays, hidden rooms tucked behind passages, multiple levels connected by stairs and ramps, small intimate spaces (bars, lounges) scattered throughout, varied ceiling heights from low cave ceilings to soaring chambers. Simple geometric shapes indicate crystal display areas. Architectural drawing style with dimension lines, section markers, rough measurements, and annotation-style text labels like 'Crystal Cavern', 'Hidden Bar', 'Deep Furnace'. Hand-sketched quality with confident but loose linework, not computer-generated precision."

### Prompt 2: Plan View Floor Layout  
"Architectural floor plan sketch of an underground labyrinth exhibition space, bird's-eye view drawn in black ink with rough hand-drawn lines. Irregular, organic layout showing interconnected rooms of various sizes connected by winding passages. Include: large circular chambers labeled 'Crystal Cavern' and 'Spectrum Gallery', smaller rectangular rooms for 'Deep Furnace' and 'Viscous Flow Chamber', tiny hidden spaces marked 'Secret Bar' and 'Collector's Lounge', narrow connecting tunnels creating a maze-like flow, multiple possible pathways between rooms, dead-end chambers, stairs indicating level changes, rough stone wall textures indicated with sketchy lines. Architectural annotation style with room labels, directional arrows, and dimension indicators. Hand-drawn architect's sketch quality - confident but loose, with cross-hatching for walls and simple symbols for fixtures."

### Prompt 3: Interior Perspective - Cave to Luxury Transition
"Rough architectural perspective sketch showing the dramatic transition from cave passage to luxury crystal chamber. Hand-drawn in black ink, loose sketchy style. Foreground shows narrow, confined cave tunnel with rough stone walls, low ceiling, moisture stains. The tunnel opens dramatically into a soaring illuminated chamber with geometric crystal displays, sophisticated lighting fixtures, and refined architectural details. Include: textural contrast between raw cave walls and polished display surfaces, dramatic lighting indicated with radiating lines, crystal formations sketched as geometric shapes with faceted surfaces, hidden bar area tucked in corner, atmospheric effects suggested with loose cross-hatching and shading. Architectural sketch quality with perspective lines, rough proportional accuracy, and annotation labels. The drawing should capture the 'raw to refined' concept central to the exhibition design."

### Prompt 4: Multi-Level Axonometric View
"Isometric architectural sketch of the underground crystal labyrinth showing three levels simultaneously. Black ink on white paper, hand-drawn with confident loose lines. Cutaway axonometric view revealing: top level with entry chambers and initial cave passages, middle level with main crystal display galleries and hidden commercial spaces, bottom level with rare specimen rooms and exclusive experiences. Show winding staircases and ramps connecting levels, varied room shapes and sizes, thick stone walls with organic curves, crystal display areas indicated as geometric forms, small hidden spaces for bars and lounges, multiple circulation routes creating labyrinthine flow. Architectural drawing conventions with hatching for cut walls, simple shading for depth, dimension lines, and room labels. Rough sketch quality emphasizing spatial relationships and discovery-based navigation flow."

### Prompt 5: Detailed Chamber Interior
"Architectural interior elevation sketch of the main Crystal Cavern chamber. Hand-drawn in black ink with loose, confident lines. Show: soaring vaulted stone ceiling with natural cave formations, dramatic spotlighting systems indicated with radiating lines, crystal specimens displayed on pedestals and wall mounts sketched as faceted geometric forms, hidden entrance to secret bar tucked behind false rock wall, sophisticated ventilation and environmental systems integrated into cave aesthetic, textural contrast between raw stone surfaces and refined display fixtures. Include architectural details like lighting placement, display case proportions, spatial flow indicators. Sketch should capture the 'underground luxury home' concept with annotations for materials, lighting, and experiential elements. Hand-drawn architect's preliminary design quality with cross-hatching, dimension indicators, and detail callouts."
