# Pyrite Exhibition Space - Architectural Design

## Core Concept
A 10,000 sq ft warehouse transformed into an immersive, non-traditional exhibition space that mimics the experience of being underground in a cave, mine shaft, or walking through a massive crystal formation.

## Spatial Organization
- **Total Space**: 10,000 sq ft industrial warehouse with existing structural character
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Steel truss ceiling systems, concrete columns, exposed utilities
- **Natural Lighting**: Dramatic skylights and clerestory windows creating light shafts
- **Room Configuration**: 10 individual cube/room modules inserted into existing space
- **Key Principle**: Rooms arranged in different orientations and heights - NOT on the same plane
- **Structural Integration**: Cube modules work with/around existing columns and beams
- **Inspiration**: Pyrite cube crystal formations - geometric but naturally clustered

## Visitor Experience Goals
- Non-traditional spatial navigation
- Cave/underground exploration feeling enhanced by industrial warehouse rawness
- Crystal formation immersion with dramatic natural lighting effects
- Three-dimensional journey rather than linear gallery walk
- Contrast between weathered warehouse and pristine geometric insertions

## Room Characteristics
- **Number**: 10 rooms total
- **Sizes**: Varied dimensions to create visual interest
- **Orientations**: Different angles, not aligned with traditional building grid
- **Stacking**: Multi-level arrangement using vertical space and existing structure
- **Connectivity**: Staircases, ladders, and transitional elements between levels
- **Content**: Each room potentially themed around specific crystal specimens
- **Integration**: Some rooms suspended from steel trusses, others ground-supported

## Design Principles
- **Non-planar arrangement**: Rooms at different heights and angles
- **Geometric symmetry**: Possible crystalline organizational logic
- **Immersive circulation**: Visitors move through 3D space, not traditional corridors
- **Industrial-organic hybrid**: Raw warehouse materials contrasted with precise geometric insertions
- **Light play**: Dramatic natural light from skylights interacting with cube volumes
- **Underground/cave atmosphere**: Enhanced by industrial rawness and dramatic lighting
- **Spatial discovery**: Non-obvious pathways and connections between existing structure and new forms
- **Material contrast**: Weathered brick/concrete warehouse vs. clean geometric room modules

## Warehouse Context Insights
- **Material Palette**: Raw brick walls, exposed steel trusses, concrete floors and columns
- **Lighting Drama**: Existing skylights create dramatic light shafts - perfect for crystal displays
- **Vertical Opportunity**: High ceilings allow for true 3D stacking of room modules
- **Industrial Character**: Weathered, authentic warehouse aesthetic enhances underground/cave feeling
- **Structural Logic**: Existing columns provide anchor points for suspended/elevated cube modules
- **Atmospheric Quality**: Natural patina and weathering adds to mineral/geological experience

## Technical Requirements
- Structural support for elevated, intersecting room modules (utilizing existing columns/beams)
- Safe circulation paths between levels
- Integration with existing warehouse infrastructure (utilities, HVAC)
- Lighting design leveraging dramatic natural light from skylights
- Artificial lighting to enhance cave/crystal atmosphere in darker zones
- Climate control for crystal specimen preservation
- Seismic/structural analysis for suspended cube modules
- Fire safety and egress planning for multi-level non-traditional layout

## Visual Reference
Think: Pyrite cube formations inserted into industrial archaeological site, underground cave systems with dramatic light shafts, three-dimensional maze structures suspended in raw warehouse space, crystal cave interiors lit by natural skylights.
